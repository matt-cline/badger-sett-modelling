# Badger Sett Modelling
  This program is a JavaScript program that visualises changing Badger Setts over time in a closed, square system of territories. This is
built using the processing.js library.

  The program consists of three parts: an index.html, processing.js (library) and settDraw.js (my work). The index file is not
particularly illuminating, it simply draws the canvas and loads the settDraw.js Javascript file. All of the work is in settDraw. The 
processing library is freeely available at processingjs.org

# settDraw
  The interface for settDraw is an 800 x 800 pixel canvas with an 800 x 100 column panel to the right. These sizes are flexible but all
of my testing took place at this resolution.
